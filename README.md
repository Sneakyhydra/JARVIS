Voice Assistant

This is a simple voice assistant made with python 3.9 using conditional statements.
This is just a fun project.

If you want to use this on your computer then read "Instructions.txt" and "Commands and Shortcuts.txt"

It uses Microsoft's SAPI5 and the male voice that comes with windows to speak.
It uses Google speech recognition to convert speech to text. 
It requires Internet connection to recognize speech.

The offline alternative Pocket Sphinx is extremely inaccurate and needs to be trained. 

It can understand only English-India.

My dream is to make this project into -
- A fully offline speech recognizing assistant
- Have a system tray icon to know the state of Script
- An AI Powered assistant
